## Abstract
This project looks into the prevalence of words associated with freedom in texts by two authors: one who wrote before 1914 and one who wrote after 1945.
These specific dates are chosen to examine the impact of the two World Wars on how freedom appears in literature.
The project seeks to identify prevelance in the use of freedom-related language, providing insights into how literature reflects society.
Ultimately, this research will contribute to understanding how the world wars shaped the way writers address universal themes like freedom.
## Background information
This direction of this research has a couple of studies that are comparable. The first study being: _Post-World War II Masculinities in British and American Literature and Culture: Towards Comparative Masculinity Studies_.

## Research question and hypothesis
The research question for this study is: How has the prevalence of freedom-related words in literature changed from before World War I to after World War II?
The hypothesis is that freedom-related themes were less prevalent in literature before the World Wars.
## Method
To answer the research question, data from Project Gutenberg will be collected. A sample of one book by an author writing before 1914 and one book by an author writing after 1945 will be selected.
A list of freedom-related words, such as liberty, independence, autonomy, and oppression, will be created.
The frequency of these words will be calculated by determining how many times they appear per 1,000 words in each book.
After calculating the freedom-to-word ratios for both books, they will be compared to see if the prevalence of freedom-related themes changed before and after the wars.
